# An Accordion Element

#### What is an Accordion?

- [Simple Accordion](https://github.com/samantehrani/simple-accordion)
- [JQuery Example](https://jqueryui.com/accordion/)
- [Some Other Examples?](https://webdesignledger.com/best-practices-accordions-in-web-design/)
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion_(GUI))

#### Requirements:

- All in plain JavaScript, no JS libraries ( jQuery, ... )


- Create a function that gets selector names as its arguments and handles the accordion functionality on the whole page when called    

  ```
  let myAccordion= function( rootSelector, itemSelector, itemTitleSelector, itemContentSelecor){    
  /* code goes here */    
  }
  ```

- It should have mutual exclusive mode.

- Styling is important, we are designers and what makes us different (in a good way) from developers is our choice of design and aesthetics. So make it stand out and be proud of your submission. That said, it doesn't have to be looking like crazy amazing (not ugly is good enough).



#### Bonus Requirements

* Make it Object Oriented
* Use ES2015
* Nested Accordion
* Add additional options to it.
* Use event delegation in your event handling
